# szotar_net

szotar_net is a terminal-based client for the Chinese-Hungarian dictionary provided by Szotar.net. It adds some additional features, such as the option to display most Chinese text in Traditional characters, or to change the phonetic system to zhuyin. It is a work in progress, it's currently functional, though still needs a lot of refinement.
